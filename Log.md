6/3: Shamay and Malcolm
- outlined the schematics of the project and began brainstorming the layout of the mancala game.
- decided that we would have a single linked list as the basis of the board, with two pointer nodes representing the first pit of each player.
- began coding the board class.

6/4: Shamay and Malcolm
- decided to follow the rules of the variant Oware, which has a few differences from Mancala.
- changed the fundamental data storage algorithm to a double linked list

6/6: Shamay and Malcolm
- added a Game class that controls the sowing and capturing as well as the turns of the two players.
- within the Game class is the Player class, which keeps track of score.

6/7: Shamay
- added the background design
- beginning work with processing graphics

6/8: Malcolm
- studying source material (there are a large number of mancala variants; in the interest of being able to write a decent AI without oversimplifying strategy to the point of imbalance, we chose Oware, a version played in West Africa and the Caribbean)

6/8: Shamay
- started on Processing Driver class used for graphics
- created a Seed class reliant on the pit it is in to determine coordinates

6/9: Malcolm and Shamay
- restructured the game class and made player a standalone
- began thinking about AI

6/10: Shamay
- edited the background image to match the Oware board
- edited the processing code to match the new background & pits
- working on animation

6/11: Shamay and Malcolm
- created skeleton code for foundation of the game
- improved graphics functionality

6/12: Shamay and Malcolm
- consolidated everything to processing

6/13:Shamay
- added visual sowing
- restructured classes to be less dependant on the Driver
- sowing reworked
- added visual pit count functionality
